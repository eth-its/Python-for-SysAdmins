    "## Recommended Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "* [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) - write better tests, write better programs\n",
    "* [pdb - the Python Debugger](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html) - typically, you start debugging your script by adding the line `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` and then execute it. The debugger will stop the program and wait for your input. These are the typical keystrokes you'll need inside the debugger:\n",
    "   * `n`(ext) execute next statement\n",
    "   * `s`(tep) when there is a function call, step will visit that function too.\n",
    "   * `c`(ontinue) exit the debugger, continue with the program\n",
    "   *`l`(ist)  show the part of the current code\n",
    "   *`ll` (long list) show a bigger part of the code\n",
    "* [defaultdict from the collections module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict) - To avoid nasty and unnecessary KeyErrors when working with dicts.  \n",
    "* [tabulate](https://github.com/astanin/python-tabulate) - displaying tabular data on console\n",
    "* [zlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zlib.html) – Compression compatible with gzip\n",
    "* [sqlite](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_python.htm) – for a lightning-fast, file-based local database\n",
    "* [SQL Alchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org) – probably the most popular ORM (Object Relational Mapper), comparable with Java's Hybernate. Supports almost any database backend and SQL dialects (MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsof SQL Server etc.). Here is a [quick guide](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy_quick_guide.htm) for getting started.\n",
    "* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html), [numpy](https://numpy.org), [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/about.html), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org): the «backbone modules» for Data Scientists. These modules are the reason why Data Scientists love Python.\n",
    "* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [Tensor Flow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) and [Keras](https://keras.io) – the three most popular machine learning platforms. They are the reason why machine learning is closely associated with Python\n",
    "* [Spacy](https://spacy.io) for natural language processing (NLP), based on pre-trained language models, with the possibility to train your own models"
